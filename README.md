### HR Attrition Analysis Project

This project analyzes employee attrition using a real-world HR dataset. The goal is to understand the key drivers behind employees leaving the organization and to present actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

# Project Structure

- `Dataset:` [IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- `Tools Used:` Excel, Power BI
- `Files:`
  - Cleaned Dataset (Excel)
  - Power BI `.pbix` file
  - Dashboard Screenshots
  - README for documentation

 ## Business Problem

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. High attrition leads to increased costs in hiring, training, and lost productivity. This project focuses on answering:
- Who is leaving the company?
- Why are they leaving?
- What patterns or factors are contributing to attrition?

## Dashboard Overview

 #  Executive Summary
- **Attrition by Department:** Research & Development has the highest attrition.
- **Attrition by Gender:** Slightly more males are leaving than females.
- **Interactive Slicers:** Filter by gender, department, and job role.

 # Attrition Drivers
- **Low Environment Satisfaction:** Strongly linked with higher attrition.
- **Education Field:** Life Sciences and Medical fields see the most attrition.
- **Job Involvement:** Employees with low involvement are more likely to leave.
- **Age Filter:** See how attrition changes with employee age.

# Income and Tenure Analysis
- **Income vs Tenure:** Monthly income generally increases with years at the company.
- **Job Role:** Sales Executive and Research Scientists show high attrition.
- **Job Level:** Lower job levels correlate with higher attrition.

 ## Key Insights

- Most attrition occurs in **Research & Development**.
- **Younger employees** (<30 years) are more likely to leave.
- **Lower satisfaction** and **low job involvement** strongly predict attrition.
- **Salary growth** improves with tenure, but many leave early.
